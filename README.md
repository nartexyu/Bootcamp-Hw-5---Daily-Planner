# Daily-Planner   
    
Created a daily planner with the ability to add tasks to each hour of the day. If the user clicks the save button, it will locally store the task so that if the page is refreshed, it will not be cleared. The hours of the day that have not come up yet are highlighted green and the current hour will be highlighted as red. All other passed hours will be grey.
